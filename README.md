# Amazon food reviews Summarization
Given a series of input text sequences and output summaries, 
that task is to build, train, and evaluate the model to produce summaries.

## Data
The dataset is the open-source amazon food reviews. It is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
For convenience, we have also shared the data on [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h5wJjjJMkld0m2sggUGqaQ1BMs2M7o8h?usp=sharing).

## Code
We have code available in Keras and Pytorch. However, the Pytorch code still needs improvement. Our main code
is in Keras.

### How to run code
In order to run the code follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Download the data
3. Create a free google account (in case you do not have it already)
4. Upload data and `attention.py` to your Google Drive (for the pytorch code only data is needed)
5. Open `summarization.py` (or any of the pytorch files) and go to Google Colab's link on top of the file
6. Create a copy of the file (go to File, then, Save a Copy on Drive)
7. Run the code
